# Sorting and Searching Visualizer
Help you understand sorting and searching algorithms more easily. As well as conducting simulations to learn the patterns of each algorithm.
* Pick the size of array and speed of process!
* Auto generate random array!
* See how long the time of execution and big-O notation

Can be used to teach CS students.
